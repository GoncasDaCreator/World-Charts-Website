This is a website that shows the statistics of the top 20 countries on each Continent in terms of Life Expectancy, Population and Surface Area.

Before we get started, open XAMPP and initiate both Apache and MySQL. Afterwards click on the "admin" button on MySQL and when the page opens, create a new database and select the import option. Import the world.sql inside the php folder into your database and then open the htdocs on the XAMPP application folder and place the three php scripts on the php folder of the project.

Once the php scripts are placed in the htdocs and the database is created, the website is ready to be used. Simply select which continent you want to explore, and the charts will be updated based on your choice.

On the middle part of the header you can see an image of the UIB logo, click it to access the UIB main website. And on the right corner of the header you can see the XAMPP logo. Click it so you can have access to the whole database. Finally on the left corner of the header you can see the title of the website and clicking it will bring you to the homepage.

You can know the specific number of any data presented on the charts by simply moving your mouse over any of the data.
